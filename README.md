# hello-world
I just want to see if it has anything special.

This is not my first time using a platform for coding. I saw some developers use GitHub and I want to give it a try.
I hope that doesn't disappoint me. :)

My main field of work and study is mechancial engineering. Although I have some knowledge about business administration.
The codes that I have written so far, are mainly focused on efficient problem solving, automated analysis processes and applying
signal processing and machine learning techniques in engineering applications.

It would be a great honor for me to have the chance to work with brilliant minds here.
